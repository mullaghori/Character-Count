# Character-Count
It's a practice program for python beginners. 
Here is a short program that counts the number of occurrences of each let-

ter in a string. Open the file editor window and enter the following code, 

saving it as characterCount.py:

message = 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.'

count = {}

for character in message:

 count.setdefault(character, 0)

 count[character] = count[character] + 1

print(count) 

The program loops over each character in the message variable’s string, 

counting how often each character appears. The setdefault() method call 

ensures that the key is in the count dictionary (with a default value of 0) 


so the program doesn’t throw a KeyError error when count[character] = 

count[character] + 1 is executed. When you run this program, the output 

will look like this:

{' ': 13, ',': 1, '.': 1, 'A': 1, 'I': 1, 'a': 4, 'c': 3, 'b': 1, 'e': 5, 'd': 3, 'g': 2, 'i': 

6, 'h': 3, 'k': 2, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'n': 4, 'p': 1, 's': 3, 'r': 5, 't': 6, 'w': 2, 'y': 1}

From the output, you can see that the lowercase letter c appears 3 times, 

the space character appears 13 times, and the uppercase letter A appears 

1 time. This program will work no matter what string is inside the message

variable, even if the string is millions of characters long!
